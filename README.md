IRTrains Stations Add On
This newgrf intends to add all of the varied types of railway stations that are commonly seen all around India.
Things that are planned and will be gradually added to the project:
*  Iconic railway stations from all around the country (Like CST,Howrah,Mughalsarai,Madras etc)
*  Will try to add depot sprites that are unique to Indian conditions
*  An added objects set in order to complement the station set ( I intend to expand the set much in the same way as it has been done in AuzStations.)
*  Last but not the least, a railway track set with unique catenary and third rail sprites to complement the station set.

This newgrf  is a part of the IRTrains Set Project.
Any bug reports should be reported to WoozyDragon4018 and SomeIndianGuy99 on the r/openttd discord or on tt-forums.net.
